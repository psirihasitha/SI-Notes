24 = 24,48,72,96
36 = 36,72,108
chec the least common multiple

so if we can take multiples of 36 and check if they are divisible by both 24 and 36 we can arrive at the solution

def lcm(a,b):
    if a>b:
        high = a
    if b>a:
        high = b
    value = high
    while True:
        if high % a== 0 and high% b==0:
            return high
        else:
            high+=value
    
print(lcm(24,36))
